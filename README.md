Each of the individual datasets have the corresponding configs inside of the `configs` directory.\
To configure the script to utilize a different config please refer to the this line inside the `gnn_citation_networks.py` file:\
`config = yaml.safe_load(open("configs/citeseer/default_citeseer_config.yaml"))`\
